Data Structures used:
1. A doubly linked list that shows stack behaviour
2. An array of pointers to functions

How to compile:
gcc A3_impl_PES1201801597.c A3_client_PES1201801597.c
	To execute(and get the output on the terminal):
	./a.out < input.txt
	To execute(and get the output to o1.txt):
	./a.out < input.txt > o1.txt
where input.txt is the input file

Key takeaway from this assignment:
This assignment helped me understand the concept of backtracking used in state space search.
