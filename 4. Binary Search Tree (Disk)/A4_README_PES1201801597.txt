Key takeaway from this assignment:
I understood that data structures(like BST), if big, cannot be built/processed by having it 
in main memory all at once. Hence I got to know that we have to store it in hard disk 
and access/process few nodes at once(which will be done in main memory). The assignment 
also taught me as to how to deal with offsets as there is no use in storing pointers.

Additional notes:
The traversals ie inorder and preorder might stack up almost all of the nodes of BST in 
main memory. Such a case is not unfavourable.
